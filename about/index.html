<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>I've been in the academe and government for more than 10 years. Much of my work is academic and I am an avid fan of MOOCs.</p>

<p>I enjoy self-directed learning and listening to The Cure, The Smiths, and spawns alike. A Star Wars fan by heart. </p>

<p>I used to chair a department for 3 years until I decided to step down and continue my passion for new things. And this is the reason why I built this site--to chronicle my so-called academic life. Or not.</p>

<p>Welcome and enjoy.</p>
