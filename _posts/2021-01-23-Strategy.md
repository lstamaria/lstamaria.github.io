- Companies desire to achieve the state of *operational effectiveness* to stand out against rivals.
- Over time, companies will find ways to learn from each other driven by *productivity frontier*.
- This leads to *competitive convergence*, a state when it is difficult to differentiate companies from each other. 
- For companies to continue standing out, they need to sustain a *strategic positioning* either by doing different activities from their rivals or by doing the same activities in different ways.
