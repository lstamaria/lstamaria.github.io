I decided to start a miscellaneous reading before I jump into my data science program. It means that I need to finish the material first before I continue with my bridge subjects which are mathematics and programming.

I am enjoying my time reading [A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU). I find it entertaining at the same time educational. Few books are of this sort. Below are some points which I find worth remembering.

* Our brain toggles between focused mode and diffuse mode.
* We experience Einstellung effect whenever we feel stuck and fixated in learning a new approach.
* One must know how to shift between focused mode and diffused mode to learn better.
* Pomodoro can be used to beat procrastination.
* Understanding of working memory  and long-term memory is essential.
* Use spaced repetition to build long-term memory.
* Sleep is important.
* It is crucial to find meaning in what you are learning.
* Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.
* Steps to build new learning:
> 1. Focus your attention.
> 2. Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk.
> 3. Gain context so you can see just not how, but also when to use this chunk.
* Highlighting or underlining a text may exhibit illusion of competence.
