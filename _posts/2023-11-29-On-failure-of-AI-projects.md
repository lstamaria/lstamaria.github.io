## Why is this study made?

- Westenberger, Schuler, and Schlegel (2022) wrote a paper that explores the critical factors that contribute to AI project failure.
- Some studies have been conducted on the critical factors of IS project success and failure; however, there is no study yet that focuses on AI projects.
- They interviewed 6 respondents to bucket the factors into the following:
    - Unrealistic expectations 
    - Use case related issues
    - Organizational constraints
    - Lack of key resources
    - Technological issues
- The study concludes that "there are several technological and non-technological factors that can lead to success or failure of AI projects" (Westenberger et al., 2022).

## Who is this study for?

- The respondents of the study belong to top, middle, and low level of management hierarchy.
- This study appears to be made for different stakeholders.

## What is useful in this study?

- Factors under unrealistic expectations are "misunderstanding of AI capabilities" and "thinking too big" related to language and culture. 
- This implies the importance of establish **shared** language and culture in the organization to make AI projects successful.

## What if?

- What if we increase this size? Will the conclusion still hold?
