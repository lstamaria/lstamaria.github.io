I am reliving my habit of Pomodoro technique. I used to apply it to my life when my work schedule was crazy. Since I'm driven to self-directing learning, I need to bring this habit back. 

My Pomodoro technique will follow this sequence:
1. Work for 25 minutes (pomodoro = 1)
2. Break for 5 minutes
3. If pomodoro < 4, repeat step 1; otherwise, break for 15 minutes
4. Repeat step 1 (to complete more tasks)


I will update this post soon with details of how my attempt went.
