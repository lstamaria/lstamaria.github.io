COVID-19 has changed everyone including businesses. How you get new customers is no longer done via face-to-face. Now, customers use digital channels to get to know you and your products. You can use these digital channels to convert visitors to customers. This is known as digital customer acquisition.

Some of the channels for digital customer acquisition are the following:

- *Organic*: When a visitor uses organic and unpaid search engine (e.g., Google) and clicks the link
- *Direct*: When a visitor knows your domain URL or has bookmarked you and clicks the link
- *Referral*: When a visitor goes to a different site that mentions you and clicks the link
- *Paid search*: When a visitor sees you in paid search engine results (usually appearing on top of search results) and clicks the link
- *Email*: When a visitor clicks the link from an email that you sent
- *Social*: When a visitor clicks the link on a social media site (e.g., Facebook)
- *Display* When a visitor clicks the link on a paid banner ad
- *Others* When a visitor click the link through other tracking features not mentioned above
