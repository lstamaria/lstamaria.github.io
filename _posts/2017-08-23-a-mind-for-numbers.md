I decided to start a miscellaneous reading before I jump into my data science program. It means that I need to finish the material first before I continue with my bridge subjects which are mathematics and programming.

I am enjoying my time reading [A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU). I find it entertaining at the same time educational. Few books are of this sort. 

Will update this post as soon as I finished the material.
