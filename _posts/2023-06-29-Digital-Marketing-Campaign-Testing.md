## Abstract
- This study explores the application of digital marketing analytics to a non-profit organization. 
- Specifically, it focuses on simplifying an A/B testing framework in three (3) steps.
- First, the hypothesis is to identify the winning marketing content that will drive more engagement in the organization's official event website.
- Next, the target audience is exposed to either a control group (a digital marketing content with static element) and treatment group (a digital marketing content with dynamic element). Exposure runs for two (2) weeks.
- Finally, conversion is tracked and analyzed leading to a decision whether to reject or not reject the hypothesis.
- The authors of this study aim to contribute to a simplified approach of scientific method in driving the right audience to the intended goals of a non-profit organization using digital channels.
