(Jupyter Notebook)[https://jupyter.org/] has been my frequently used tool when working. Together with (Conda)[https://anaconda.org/], they have made my life easier. I am listing down some of my frequently used packages in data science.

```
conda update -n base conda
conda install -c anaconda jupyter 
conda install -c anaconda numpy 
conda install -c anaconda pandas 
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
conda install -c conda-forge autopep8
conda install -c anaconda scipy 
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel 
```
