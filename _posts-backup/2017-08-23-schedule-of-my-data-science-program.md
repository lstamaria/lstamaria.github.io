I integrated Pomodoro to my learning approach. I alloted 20 minutes to each subject everyday including weekends. I have 3 major sections in my program: bridge, core, and electives. Bridge covers mathematics and programming. Core are professional subjects. Electives are areas of my interest.

## Bridge
1. Mathematics
	- Principles of Statistics
	- Probability Theory
	- Linear Algebra
	- Calculus
2. Programming
	- Python

## Core
1. Intro to Data Science
2. Data Visualization
3. Machine Learning
4. Deep Learning

## Electives
1. NumPy
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. TensorFlow
5. Raspberry Pi

Breakdown of time is as follows:

* pomodoro 1 = 20 min; break = 5 min
* pomodoro 2 = 20 min; break = 5 min
* pomodoro 3 = 20 min; break = 5 min
* pomodoro 4 = 20 min; long break = 15 min

Total time is 110 min or (1 hour and 50 minutes).

One remaining issue that I have yet to resolve. I haven't covered the scope of my subjects. I intend to settle this as I move along each subject and skip the some topics I have gone through such as Mathematics. However, I don't want to overlook the importance of this area that's why I supplemented it with more readings.

I am giving myself one month (whole September) to test this program. Fingers crossed that it will have a positive outcome. I will update this post for any changes.
